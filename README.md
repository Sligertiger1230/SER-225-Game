# SER225 RPG Game

## What is this?
This is a game created for Quinnipiac's SER225 Agile Development class.

## How to run this project?
I did not use any external libraries for this, so you can clone this repo as is and run it out of the box with Java (min version 8).
I recommend using an IDE such as IntelliJ or Eclipse to run this game.

The main method for the game is in the `Game` package > `Game.java` file.<br>
The main method for the map editor is in the `MapEditor` package > `MapEditor.java` file.

## Documentation
This project includes a GitHub pages website in the `docs` folder where the documentation resides.<br>
It can be accessed at [https://a-r-t.github.io/SER-225-Game-RPG/](https://a-r-t.github.io/SER-225-Game-RPG/).

Changes to content in the `docs` folder will not show up on the website unless they are pushed to the `master` branch.
